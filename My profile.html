<h2> Personal Information </h2>


<p> Hello everyone, my name is Kunpeng Xu. My student number is s3954480. My email address is s3954480@student.rmit.edu.au. I am from China and this is my seventh year in Australia.
I have been living in Adelaide for the past seven years. I chose to live in this country when I was 17 because Australia has less stress.
In 2018 I graduated from Adelaide High School, and I also learned a lot about local cultures, but I still use Chinese to talk to my family at home.
I am an optimistic person. In my free time, I tend to gather my friends to play various games or chat together. Because I enjoy the time with my friends.
I often go to the gym to let my body get more fitness, as I’m also a basketball player. </p>

<h3>Interest in IT </h3>

<p>When I was very young I enjoyed watching some sci-fi and action movies. There is often some advanced special effects technology in movies.
I used to ask my parents how these things were created and they would tell me it was created with a computer. Since then, I started to get interested in computers.
There are also some movies where hackers look cool; they're very skilled at manipulating computers to crack codes. The reason why I chose RMIT is that his science and technology major is very famous in Australia.
They would have advanced teaching techniques. By learning this course, I want to use this programming software proficiently and be able to quickly analyze the errors in the code. </p>

<h7> Choose Unity for Game Development</h7>
<img src="unity.png">

<p>Overview:
As the progress of the modern game industry, people's game demand is also increasing. Therefore, many creative elements and picture quality are important factors to be able to comment on the game, whether good or not.
Without a proper tool to bring it into the world, a creative idea can only be a fantasy. Unity game engine is a key creative element for game developers; it is an attractive digital brush.
Gamers and aspiring developers who are curious about how games come to life definitely should understand the importance of Unity. </p>

<p>Description:
Unity is a multi-platform comprehensive game development tool, developed by Unity Technologies that allows players to easily create interactive content such as 3D video games, architectural visualization, and real-time 3D animation. It is  a fully integrated and it’s a professional game engine.
 At the same time, it is also loved by artists because of its powerful animation tools that can easily create 3d cut-scenes and sophisticated 2d animations. Almost everything can be animated by using Unity. It provides C# for independent game developers rather than C++. Because C++ is harder than C#.
No matter your budget or coding background, you still can use Unity, as it's easy to learn, and Unity has built-in physics so developers don't have to deal with every detail. As Unity has been created in 2005, it has already collected massive users and a large number of inventories. It provides excellent online tutorials, which attract beginners to learn it patiently.
There is a convenient feature of Unity is the “asset store”, which is definitely worth checking it out.
There are thousands of materials, models, scripts, scenes and everything else you need for your design; it allows developers to download all materials or upload their own creations. If you need to create a fire effect, but don't want to start with the first steps, at this point you can choose to check the “asset store”, which may have the material you want.
Prefabs are Unity's primary approach to game development.
Using prefabs, designers can create objects and environments faster and expand new things more efficiently.
Unity also offers impressive graphics. Because it leverages powerful shaders, physically based materials, post processing, and high resolution lighting systems. A major appeal to deployment is cross-platform, which is Unity's specialty in this area.
Team collaboration has been improved a lot in the latest Unity version, as built-in version control is easier than before with others.
Unity can absolutely support every single control platform and operating system. And Unity can also create games on many large platforms. E.g Android, Apple TV, BlackBerry 10, iOS, Linux,Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 4, Unity Web Player (including Facebook), Wii, Windows, Xbox 360,Xbox One.  
Among many game development engines, Unity can be described as the leader; it knowledge and technology are completely built on the incredible field. </p>

<p>Tools and Technologies:
Writing a lot of multi-threaded code is a very hard thing to manage and add new features to. This means that it takes more time and money investment to get the results you want. So Unity chose the C# system to complete complex projects, which simplifies the developer's time and saves unnecessary investment.
 Unity's relevant departments have achieved the best state through many practices, it  means they can find the issues and fix them faster.
Another technology used by Unity is DOTS Netcode1.0. The 2020 release of Unity has an open-source framework that includes built-in features like client-side prediction, lag compensation, and more. These features make it easier to complete operations when we need to take advantage of optimization techniques to achieve the best simulation experience. </p>

<p>Skills Required:
All IT industries can't get around programming, and Unity is no exception. If you want to use Unity, you really need to know how to use C# to write the code. Even though you may not need to write code at work, you still need it as a basic language to communicate with other programmers; it’s an effective way to communicate and share your ideas.
Using Unity's asset store is a very important skill as well. If you use it properly, it can be a powerful tool. Using the store is to avoid rebuilding an unnecessary script, which will save you a lot of time. It saves you a lot of time for game development and you would become an efficient developer.
The skills mentioned above are achievable and you can learn them through various ways, such as online tutorials or university courses. </p>

<p>Outcome:
With the development of time, people will continue to explore and develop new technologies to improve the quality of the game, and Unity is one of them.
Unity can be described as in the leading position in all aspects of game development technology. It will continue to show us a different gaming experience.
Unity's various game products also show us the future of game development. Unity could also be a future leader, as people could endorse its influence.
Designers will continue to use Unity to develop more perfect games, and more impressive games will be shown in front of players.</p>
